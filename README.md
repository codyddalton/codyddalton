**<h1 align="center">Hello there! I'm Cody.</h1>**

<p>Welcome to my Github. Make yourself at home. At the time of writing, I'm working on a few independent projects while I'm making out applications looking for work. I have a Bachelor's degree from Full Sale University in Web Development and Design (2021-2023) and I'm getting set to start an additional course from FSU in Graphic Design starting in September.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the projects I'm currently working on: </p>
